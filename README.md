# Git history banners

The github activity calendar excels as a textbook example of the humblebrag,
but what if you want to convey more than how productive you are?

1. Create a new repository.

2. Check it out.

3. `commits.py "help I'm trapped in an open source enterprise shop"`

4. Push.

Eventually github will backfill your commit history.
